      <description>I was inspired to implement this algorithm due to a couple of reasons. The main one being this video by Siraj Raval. The second reason being that I am interested in learning about the fundamentals of machine learning.
Here is a link to the source code if you are interested.
K-Means What? K-Means Clustering is considered an Unsupervised learning algorithm. More specifically it is a clustering algorithm that is able to classify n-dimensional vectors into k distinct groups.</description>
